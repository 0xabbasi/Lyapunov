# Lyapunov

README File:
Lyapunov Equation Solver
This Python script provides a function to solve the continuous-time Lyapunov equation:

css
Copy code
A*X + X*A.T = -Q
where A and Q are input matrices, and X is the unknown matrix we want to solve for.

Usage:
Requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required libraries: NumPy, SciPy.
Installation:

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy
Using the Script:

Import the solve_lyapunov function from the provided Python script.
Call the function solve_lyapunov(A, Q) with matrices A and Q as arguments.
It returns the solution matrix X.
Example:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from lyapunov_solver import solve_lyapunov

A = np.array([[1, -1], [2, -3]])
Q = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
X = solve_lyapunov(A, Q)
print("Solution X:")
print(X)
Notes:
Ensure that matrices A and Q are appropriately defined and compatible for solving the Lyapunov equation.
The function uses the solve_continuous_lyapunov function from SciPy's scipy.linalg module to solve the Lyapunov equation.
This README file provides basic instructions for using the Lyapunov equation solver script. Adjustments can be made as per specific requirements.
